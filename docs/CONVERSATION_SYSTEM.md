# Conversational Financial Advisor System

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the conversational financial advisor system, including its architecture, components, implementation details, and testing approach.

## Overview

The conversational financial advisor system is designed to provide human-like financial guidance through natural language interactions. It combines advanced language models, conversation management, context awareness, and financial domain knowledge to deliver personalized financial advice.

## Key Components

### 1. Conversation Management

The conversation management system handles the core interaction between users and the financial advisor:

- **Conversation Manager**: Coordinates the overall conversation flow
- **Message Handling**: Processes incoming and outgoing messages
- **Context Tracking**: Maintains conversation context across turns
- **Response Generation**: Generates appropriate responses to user queries

### 2. Conversation Storage

The conversation storage system persists conversation history for continuity and analysis:

#### Features
- **In-memory caching**: Fast access to recent conversations
- **Persistent storage**: Multiple backend options (File, DynamoDB)
- **Conversation management**: Create, read, update, and delete operations
- **Message management**: Add, retrieve, and search messages within conversations
- **Search capabilities**: Find conversations by user ID or content
- **Flexible metadata**: Attach additional information to conversations and messages

#### Storage Implementations
- **InMemoryConversationStorage**: Stores conversations in memory for fast access
- **FileConversationStorage**: Persists conversations to the file system as JSON
- **DynamoDbConversationStorage**: Stores conversations in Amazon DynamoDB for scalability

#### DynamoDB Implementation
The DynamoDB implementation provides:
- Automatic table creation and initialization
- Support for global secondary indexes for efficient querying
- Proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- Efficient schema design for conversations and messages

### 3. Conversation Summarization

The conversation summarization feature automatically generates concise summaries of financial advisor conversations:

#### Features
- Generate summaries of entire conversations
- Update existing summaries with new conversation turns
- Extract and highlight key financial entities and decisions
- Prioritize information based on financial relevance
- Support different summary types (brief, detailed, topic-focused)

#### Components
- **SummaryGenerator**: Generates summaries of conversations
- **SummaryStorage**: Stores and retrieves conversation summaries
- **EntityExtractor**: Extracts financial entities from conversations
- **ImportanceScorer**: Scores the importance of information in conversations

#### Implementations
- **BedrockSummaryGenerator**: Generates summaries using AWS Bedrock LLMs
- **InMemorySummaryStorage**: Stores summaries in memory
- **DynamoDbSummaryStorage**: Stores summaries in DynamoDB
- **LlmEntityExtractor**: Extracts entities using LLMs
- **RuleBasedImportanceScorer**: Scores importance based on rules

### 4. Financial Knowledge Base

The financial knowledge base stores structured financial information that can be used by the conversational financial advisor to provide accurate and relevant responses to user queries.

#### Features
- **Core Knowledge Base Structure**: Flexible categorization system with comprehensive knowledge entries
- **Knowledge Management**: Methods for adding, retrieving, and searching knowledge entries
- **Data Persistence**: Support for loading and saving knowledge entries from/to JSON files
- **Integration with Conversation System**: Seamless integration with the conversation manager

#### Components
- **FinancialKnowledgeBase**: Manages financial knowledge entries
- **FinancialKnowledgeCategory**: Categorizes knowledge entries
- **FinancialKnowledgeSource**: Tracks sources of knowledge
- **RelevanceScorer**: Ranks search results by relevance

#### Implementation Details
- Category-based organization of knowledge entries
- Intent-based retrieval to match user intents with relevant knowledge
- Text-based search with relevance ranking
- Configuration options for knowledge base management

### 5. Human-Like Conversation Capabilities

The system implements several features to make conversations more human-like:

#### Memory and Context Awareness
- Conversation summarization for maintaining context
- Client profile building and updating
- Recognition of conversation topic shifts

#### Natural Language Capabilities
- Enhanced intent recognition
- Nuanced response generation
- Personalized communication style
- Appropriate use of financial terminology

#### Emotional Intelligence
- Recognition of user emotions and concerns
- Empathetic responses to financial stress
- Confidence calibration based on certainty
- Appropriate tone for different financial situations

## Testing Approach

The conversation system is tested using a comprehensive approach:

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components in isolation
- Verify correct behavior of each class and method
- Use mock dependencies for controlled testing

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components
- Verify end-to-end conversation flows
- Test storage and retrieval operations

### Quality Evaluation
- Evaluate summary quality against human benchmarks
- Assess natural language understanding accuracy
- Measure human-likeness of responses

### Performance Testing
- Measure response time under various loads
- Test storage system scalability
- Evaluate token usage efficiency

## Usage Examples

### Basic Conversation

```rust
use conversation_system::{ConversationManager, Message, Role};

// Create a new conversation manager
let mut manager = ConversationManager::new();

// Start a conversation
let conversation_id = manager.create_conversation("user123");

// Add messages to the conversation
manager.add_message(conversation_id, Message {
    role: Role::User,
    content: "How much should I save for retirement?".to_string(),
});

// Get a response
let response = manager.generate_response(conversation_id);
```

### Using Persistent Storage

```rust
use conversation_system::{PersistentConversationManager, DynamoDbStorage};

// Create a DynamoDB storage backend
let storage = DynamoDbStorage::new("conversations-table");

// Create a persistent conversation manager
let manager = PersistentConversationManager::new(storage);

// Load a previous conversation
let conversation = manager.load_conversation("conv-123");

// Continue the conversation
manager.add_message(conversation.id, Message {
    role: Role::User,
    content: "What about tax implications?".to_string(),
});
```

### Using the Knowledge Base

```rust
use conversation_system::{ConversationManager, KnowledgeBase, Message, Role};

// Create a knowledge base
let mut knowledge_base = KnowledgeBase::new();

// Add knowledge entries
knowledge_base.add_entry(
    "retirement_planning",
    "The 4% rule suggests withdrawing 4% of your retirement savings in the first year, then adjusting for inflation each subsequent year.",
    "financial_planning",
);

// Create a conversation manager with knowledge base
let mut manager = ConversationManager::with_knowledge_base(knowledge_base);

// Use the knowledge base in conversations
let conversation_id = manager.create_conversation("user123");
manager.add_message(conversation_id, Message {
    role: Role::User,
    content: "What is the 4% rule for retirement?".to_string(),
});

// The response will incorporate knowledge from the knowledge base
let response = manager.generate_response(conversation_id);
```

## Future Improvements

- Enhanced multi-turn reasoning for complex financial questions
- Improved personalization based on user financial profile
