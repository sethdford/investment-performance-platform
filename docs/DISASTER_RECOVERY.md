## Introduction

The Investment Performance Calculator is a critical application that calculates performance metrics for investment portfolios. This disaster recovery plan outlines the procedures to recover the application in the event of a disaster.

## Recovery Objectives

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

The maximum acceptable length of time that the application can be down after a disaster:

- **Production Environment**: 4 hours
- **Test Environment**: 8 hours
- **Development Environment**: 24 hours

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time:

- **Production Environment**: 15 minutes
- **Test Environment**: 1 hour
- **Development Environment**: 24 hours

## Disaster Scenarios

### Infrastructure Failure

- **AWS Region Outage**: Complete loss of the primary AWS region.
- **Service Outage**: Outage of specific AWS services (e.g., DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway).
- **Network Outage**: Loss of network connectivity.

### Data Corruption or Loss

- **Database Corruption**: Corruption of DynamoDB data.
- **Accidental Deletion**: Accidental deletion of data or resources.
- **Malicious Attack**: Data corruption or deletion due to a malicious attack.

### Application Failure

- **Code Defects**: Critical bugs in the application code.
- **Configuration Errors**: Misconfiguration of the application or infrastructure.
- **Dependency Failures**: Failures in external dependencies.

## Recovery Procedures

### Infrastructure Failure

#### AWS Region Outage

1. **Activate Secondary Region**:
   - Deploy the application to the secondary region using the CloudFormation template.
   - Update DNS records to point to the secondary region.

2. **Restore Data**:
   - Restore DynamoDB data from the latest backup.
   - Restore Timestream data from the latest backup.

3. **Verify Application**:
   - Verify that the application is functioning correctly in the secondary region.
   - Run basic tests to ensure data integrity.

#### Service Outage

1. **Identify Affected Services**:
   - Monitor AWS service health dashboard.
   - Check CloudWatch alarms and logs.

2. **Implement Workarounds**:
   - Use cached data if available.
   - Implement fallback mechanisms.

3. **Restore Services**:
   - Once AWS services are restored, verify application functionality.
   - Check for data consistency.

### Data Corruption or Loss

#### Database Corruption

1. **Identify Corruption**:
   - Monitor data integrity checks.
   - Investigate anomalies in application behavior.

2. **Isolate Affected Data**:
   - Identify affected records.
   - Prevent further corruption.

3. **Restore from Backup**:
   - Restore DynamoDB data from the latest backup before corruption.
   - Verify data integrity after restoration.

#### Accidental Deletion

1. **Identify Deleted Resources**:
   - Check CloudTrail logs for deletion events.
   - Identify affected resources.

2. **Restore Resources**:
   - Restore deleted resources from backups.
   - Recreate resources using CloudFormation if necessary.

3. **Verify Restoration**:
   - Verify that all resources are restored correctly.
   - Check application functionality.

### Application Failure

#### Code Defects

1. **Identify Defect**:
   - Analyze error logs and stack traces.
   - Reproduce the issue in a test environment.

2. **Deploy Fix**:
   - Develop and test a fix for the defect.
   - Deploy the fix to the affected environment.

3. **Verify Fix**:
   - Verify that the fix resolves the issue.
   - Monitor for any regressions.

#### Configuration Errors

1. **Identify Misconfiguration**:
   - Review configuration changes.
   - Check CloudTrail logs for configuration changes.

2. **Correct Configuration**:
   - Revert to the last known good configuration.
   - Apply correct configuration.

3. **Verify Configuration**:
   - Verify that the configuration is correct.
   - Test application functionality.

## Testing and Maintenance

### Regular Testing

- **Backup Restoration**: Test backup restoration quarterly.
- **Failover Testing**: Test failover to the secondary region semi-annually.
- **Disaster Recovery Drill**: Conduct a full disaster recovery drill annually.

### Plan Maintenance

- **Review**: Review the disaster recovery plan quarterly.
- **Update
