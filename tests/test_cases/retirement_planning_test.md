# Test Case: Retirement Planning Model

## Test Case Information

**Test ID**: TC-2.3.1  
**Related TODO Item**: Implement retirement planning model with Monte Carlo simulations  
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Integration  
**Created By**: Financial Advisor AI Team  
**Created Date**: 2023-09-15  

## Test Objective

Validate that the retirement planning model accurately projects retirement outcomes using Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating various factors such as inflation, investment returns, Social Security benefits, and withdrawal strategies.

## Prerequisites

- Client profile data loaded (use `tests/data/client_profiles/sample_profiles.json`)
- Market data available (use `tests/data/market_data/historical_returns.json`)
- Financial products catalog loaded (use `tests/data/financial_products/investment_vehicles.json`)
- Monte Carlo simulation engine initialized with appropriate parameters

## Test Data

| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| Client profile "client-001" (35-year-old with moderate risk tolerance) | Success probability > 80% for retirement at age 65 with $80,000 annual income | Using default market assumptions |
| Client profile "client-002" (55-year-old with conservative risk tolerance) | Success probability > 70% for retirement at age 65 with $100,000 annual income | Using default market assumptions |
| Client profile "client-003" (28-year-old with aggressive risk tolerance) | Success probability > 90% for retirement at age 65 with $70,000 annual income | Using default market assumptions |

## Test Steps

1. Load the client profile from the test data
2. Configure the retirement planning model with the following parameters:
   - Retirement age: 65
   - Life expectancy: 90
   - Inflation rate: 2.5%
   - Investment return assumptions based on risk profile
   - Social Security benefits based on income history
3. Run the Monte Carlo simulation with 1,000 iterations
4. Calculate the success probability (percentage of simulations where the portfolio doesn't run out of money)
5. Generate retirement income projections for different withdrawal strategies:
   - Fixed percentage (4%)
   - Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) based
   - Dynamic spending (adjusting based on portfolio performance)
6. Compare the results with expected outcomes

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Success probability calculations are accurate within 2% margin of error
- [ ] Retirement income projections account for inflation correctly
- [ ] Social Security benefits are calculated accurately based on earnings history
- [ ] Different withdrawal strategies produce expected differences in outcomes
- [ ] Portfolio allocations adjust appropriately based on time to retirement
- [ ] Tax implications of different account types (Traditional vs. Roth) are correctly modeled
- [ ] The model handles edge cases (early retirement, late retirement, partial retirement) correctly

    #[test]
    fn test_retirement_projection_moderate_risk() {
        // Arrange
        let client_profile = ClientProfile::load_from_file("tests/data/client_profiles/sample_profiles.json", "client-001").unwrap();
        let market_assumptions = MarketAssumptions::default_for_risk_profile("moderate");
        
        let model = RetirementPlanningModel::new()
            .with_client_profile(client_profile)
            .with_market_assumptions(market_assumptions)
            .with_retirement_age(65)

        // Act
        let result = model.run_projection().unwrap();
        
        // Assert
        assert!(result.success_probability() > 0.80, 
                "Success probability should be greater than 80%");
        
        // Test different withdrawal strategies
        let fixed_withdrawal = model.with_withdrawal_strategy(WithdrawalStrategy::FixedPercentage(0.04))
                                   .run_projection().unwrap();
        let rmd_withdrawal = model.with_withdrawal_strategy(WithdrawalStrategy::RequiredMinimumDistribution)
                                 .run_projection().unwrap();
        let dynamic_withdrawal = model.with_withdrawal_strategy(WithdrawalStrategy::Dynamic)
                                     .run_projection().unwrap();
        
        // Compare strategies
        assert!(dynamic_withdrawal.success_probability() >= fixed_withdrawal.success_probability(),
                "Dynamic withdrawal should have equal or higher success probability than fixed");
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn test_retirement_projection_conservative_risk() {
        // Similar test for conservative risk profile (client-002)
        // ...
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn test_retirement_projection_aggressive_risk() {
        // Similar test for aggressive risk profile (client-003)
        // ...
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn test_social_security_optimization() {
        // Test Social Security claiming strategies
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Reproduction Command

```bash
cargo test --package investment-management-platform --lib financial_advisor::retirement_planning::tests::test_retirement_projection
```

## Edge Cases to Consider

- Early retirement (before age 60)
- Late retirement (after age 70)
- Partial retirement (reduced income while still working part-time)
- Market crashes near retirement date
- Unexpectedly high inflation periods
- Longevity beyond life expectancy
- Changes in tax laws affecting retirement accounts

## Potential Failure Scenarios

- Monte Carlo simulation doesn't converge to stable results
- Social Security calculation fails due to incomplete earnings history
- Tax calculations fail due to complex tax situations
- Portfolio allocation fails to meet risk/return requirements
- Withdrawal strategy calculations produce unrealistic income amounts

## Dependencies

- Monte Carlo simulation engine
- Market data service
- Social Security benefit calculator
- Tax calculation module
- Portfolio optimization module

## Notes

This test validates the core functionality of the retirement planning model. Additional tests should be created for specific features such as Roth conversion strategies, Social Security optimization, and tax-efficient withdrawal sequencing. The model should be periodically recalibrated with updated market assumptions and tax parameters.
