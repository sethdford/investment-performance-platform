# Modern Investment Management Platform

A modern investment management platform powered by a human-level conversational financial advisor using emerging AI techniques.

## Overview

This platform combines advanced financial modeling with state-of-the-art conversational AI to provide a comprehensive investment management solution. The system is designed to help financial advisors and individuals manage their investments more effectively, optimize tax strategies, and plan for financial goals.

## Key Features

### Conversational Financial Advisor

- **Human-like Conversations**: Engage in natural, contextually-aware conversations about financial topics
- **Enhanced Context Management**: Intelligently manages conversation context to maintain coherent and relevant discussions
  - Context window management with token-based pruning
  - Context relevance scoring based on topics and entities
  - Context persistence with file-based storage
- **Topic Detection**: Automatically identifies financial topics in conversations
- **Entity Extraction**: Recognizes financial entities like accounts, amounts, and instruments
- **Persistence**: Saves and loads conversation context across sessions

### Financial Planning and Analysis

- **Portfolio Management**: Create and manage model portfolios with sophisticated asset allocation
- **Tax Optimization**: Implement tax-efficient strategies including tax-loss harvesting
- **Retirement Planning**: Plan for retirement with dynamic withdrawal strategies and Monte Carlo simulations
- **Goal-based Planning**: Set and track financial goals with personalized recommendations

### Technical Capabilities

- **AWS Bedrock Integration**: Leverages Claude 3 Sonnet for advanced NLP capabilities
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Accesses a comprehensive financial knowledge base for accurate information
- **Context Window Management**: Intelligently manages the LLM context window for optimal performance
- **Relevance Scoring**: Prioritizes the most relevant information for generating responses

## Architecture

The platform is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and allows for easy extension:

- **Conversation Module**: Manages conversations, context, and topic detection
- **Financial Entities Module**: Handles entity extraction and financial data
- **Financial Advisor Module**: Provides advanced NLP and financial knowledge capabilities
- **Portfolio Module**: Manages investment portfolios and asset allocation
- **Performance Calculator**: Calculates and analyzes investment performance
- **Factor Model**: Implements factor-based analysis and asset allocation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
