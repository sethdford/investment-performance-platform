# Investment Performance Platform

A serverless Rust application for calculating investment portfolio performance metrics.

## Overview

The Investment Performance Calculator is a high-performance, scalable system built on AWS serverless architecture. It provides APIs for managing investment portfolios, items, and transactions, and calculates various performance metrics such as Time-Weighted Return (TWR), Money-Weighted Return (MWR), volatility, Sharpe ratio, and more.

## Architecture

The application follows a serverless, event-driven architecture:

- **API Handler**: AWS Lambda function that processes API requests
- **Event Processor**: AWS Lambda function that processes events from SQS
- **Performance Calculator**: AWS Lambda function that calculates performance metrics
- **Data Storage**: DynamoDB for entity data and Timestream for time-series metrics
- **Message Queue**: SQS for asynchronous processing

## Features

- Portfolio management (create, read, update, delete)
- Item management within portfolios
- Transaction recording and management
- Performance calculation with various methodologies
- Batch calculation for multiple portfolios
- Time series data for historical performance
- Multi-tenant support with data isolation
- Caching for improved performance
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
